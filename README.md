# terraform-aws-cloudfront-s3-cdn

Terraform module to easily provision an AWS CloudFront CDN with an S3 or custom origin.

## Usage

```hcl
module "cdn" {
  source           = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-cloudfront-s3-cdn.git?ref=master"
  namespace        = "${var.namespace}"
  stage            = "${var.stage}"
  name             = "${var.name}"
  aliases          = "${var.hostname}"
  parent_zone_name = "${var.parent_zone_name}"
}
```

### Generating ACM Certificate

Use the AWS cli to [request new ACM certifiates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request.html) (requires email validation)
```
aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --subject-alternative-names a.example.com b.example.com *.c.example.com
```

## Known Issues

If the bucket is created in a region other than `us-east-1`, it will take a while for the distribution to become fully operational.

> All buckets have at least two REST endpoint hostnames. In eu-west-1, they are example-bucket.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com and example-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com. The first one will be immediately valid when the bucket is created. The second one -- sometimes referred to as the "global endpoint" -- which is the one CloudFront uses -- will not, unless the bucket is in us-east-1. Over a period of seconds to minutes, variable by location and other factors, it becomes globally accessible as well. Before that, the 307 redirect is returned. Hence, the bucket was not ready.
